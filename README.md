1. Project Overview​

This project serves as a hands - on exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the realm of deep learning. By utilizing the COCO dataset for object detection, you'll navigate through the entire process, from initial data preprocessing to the final stages of model training, evaluation, and performance analysis. It's an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge and build a functional image recognition system.

2. Objectives​

- Implement a proficient image recognition model using CNN architecture.

- Preprocess the COCO dataset effectively for object detection tasks.

- Train the model to achieve optimal performance and thoroughly evaluate its accuracy and reliability.
- Experiment Steps​

3.1 Dataset Preparation and Processing

- Load the COCO dataset, carefully extracting images and their corresponding labels for each object instance.

- Employ the MyCOCODataset class to seamlessly load data into PyTorch’s DataLoader. Carry out essential image processing operations such as cropping, resizing, and normalization to ready the data for model training.

3.2 Model Implementation

- Complete the implementation of the AlexNet network. Adjust the input and output layers to precisely match the 7 object categories present in the COCO dataset subset used.

- Ensure the accurate implementation of convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and the ReLU activation function. Verify that the network performs forward propagation without glitches.

3.3 Model Training

- Train the model using the Cross - Entropy loss function (CrossEntropyLoss) in conjunction with the Adam optimizer (optim.Adam).

- Save the model weights to best_model.pth upon successful completion of the training process. This allows for easy retrieval and further use of the trained model.

3.4 Evaluation and Performance Analysis

- Load the trained model and put it to the test on the designated test set.

- Compute and record the model's accuracy on the test set. This metric provides a quick overview of the model's overall performance.

- Calculate and visualize the confusion matrix. This matrix offers in - depth insights into the model's performance on each individual category, highlighting areas of strength and weakness.

3.5 Visualization

- Use matplotlib to create a detailed plot of the confusion matrix. Analyze the model's prediction performance across different categories by studying the matrix.

- Observe and reflect on the model’s classification results. Identify potential areas for improvement in the model's design or training process based on these observations.
